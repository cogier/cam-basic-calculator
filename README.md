# Camden's Basic Calculator App

This basic calculator app was built using react. It can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It also has functionality for negative numbers and decimals, as well as a backspace and clear key.
Note that the clear key resets all inputs of the calculator.

A number must be input before selecting an operator. If multiple operators are selected, the last one selected will be used.
If a second number is entered after selecting an operator, the operator cannot be changed until the current equation is evaluated. Selecting equals will evaluate the equation and allow another operator to be chosen. Using clear will also reset.
